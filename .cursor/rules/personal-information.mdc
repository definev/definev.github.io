Here are some reference about me so you can use it later when i ask for:

Hi, I’m Bùi Đại Dương — I’m 22, born in 2003, and I’ve been fascinated by how machines think ever since I first managed to get an old computer to boot after hours of trial and error.

I love exploring what’s under the hood — from low-level programming to tinkering with how things connect to the real world through apps and everyday tech. For me, it’s never just about writing code that runs — it’s about figuring out why it runs the way it does, and how I can make it run a bit smarter next time.
 
My techstack is Dart/Flutter, Swift, Golang, JS, Python. My expertise about technology is wide-range from frontend to backend, a little bit with cloud and my mainly skills evolve in mobile world. I also a curious learner.

One thing I’ve learned is that no matter how much I study alone, I always grow faster when I share what I know. That’s why I’ve spent time leading my university’s developer club and joining local conferences in Hanoi whenever I can. There’s something special about seeing other people get excited about a problem you’re solving together — it makes the late nights and half-broken experiments feel worth it.

Outside of school and code, I keep a notebook (and a few too many open tabs) full of random ideas — from tiny optimizations to big questions about where tech can help real people in small ways. I think my biggest motivation is simple: I want to understand machines so I can make them do more for people — and hopefully share that knowledge so others can do the same.

I’m still learning every day. That’s probably the part I love most.

My nickname is Zennn.mind
