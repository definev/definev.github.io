## Self Introduction

Hi all! I'm Dương, a software engineer from Vietnam. I'm currently learning at [Phenikaa University](https://phenikaa-uni.edu.vn/). I'm interested in software development and low-level programming. I'm also a big fan of history and philosophy. I love to learn new things and share my knowledge with others.

I'm familiar with: [Dart](https://dart.dev), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and C/C++. Currently, I'm learning [Go](https://golang.org) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I'm obbsessed with animations and UI/UX design. Love to learn about new technologies and frameworks.


My passion for programming ignited at the age of 14 when I decided to jailbreak my iPhone 4S. As I delved into this process, I couldn't help but wonder about the creation of the jailbreak tool and the development of apps. The concept of bringing something to life from scratch fascinated me. Initially, I began my programming journey with Pascal, but its limitations led me to explore C/C++. I immersed myself in understanding algorithms and data structures, using them to tackle various problems.

Despite this technical exploration, my true desire was to craft something practical for people to use. My inaugural project was a snake game coded in C++, albeit in the console (even though not many people use the console these days). As I grasped the fundamentals, my quest for broader horizons led me to discover Flutter in 2019—a cross-platform framework enabling the creation of visually stunning applications for both Android and iOS. Since then, my love for Flutter has only deepened.
