> Hành trình vạn dặm, bắt đầu từ một bước chân - Lão Tử

Hi! My name is Dương. After a long time of thinking and procrastinating, I finally decided to start my own blog. I'm a software engineer, and I'm interested in many things, including but not limited to: **programming, math, physics, philosophy, psychology, and history**. I hope that I can share my knowledge and experience with you through this blog.

## Why I started this blog

The reason is simple: I want to learn a static site generator. I've been using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for a while, and I'm quite satisfied with it. I also want to have a place to share my knowledge and experience. I hope that I can help you with my blog and hope you enjoy it!

### Caution

- I'm not a native English speaker, so there might be some grammar mistakes in my posts. If you find any, please let me know. 
- I'm not a professional writer, so my writing might not be good. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
- I'm not an expert in any field, so there might be some mistakes in my posts. If you find any, please let me know.

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy my blog. If you have any questions, please let me know. You can contact me via [email](mailto:daiduong.workmail@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/definev2).
