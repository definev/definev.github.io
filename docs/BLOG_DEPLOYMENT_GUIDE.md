# Blog System Deployment Guide

## Overview

Your blog system has been updated to work seamlessly with Cloudflare deployment. The system now pre-processes all markdown content during build time and generates a static JSON file that can be served efficiently from Cloudflare's edge locations.

## How It Works

### 1. Build-Time Processing

- **Build Script**: `scripts/build-blog.js` processes all markdown files
- **Content Source**: Markdown files in `content/blog/` directory
- **Output**: Static JSON file at `public/blog-data.json`
- **Build Command**: `bun run build` (includes blog generation)

### 2. Runtime Loading

- **Development**: Reads directly from filesystem for hot-reload
- **Production**: Loads from pre-built `blog-data.json` file
- **Caching**: Blog data is cached in memory for performance
- **Fallback**: Graceful handling if blog data is unavailable

## Deployment Process

### For Cloudflare Pages/Workers

1. **Build the blog data**:
   ```bash
   bun run build:blog
   ```

2. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```
   
   Or use the combined command:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

3. **Deploy to Cloudflare**:
   ```bash
   bun run deploy:cloudflare
   ```

The `blog-data.json` file will be automatically included in the deployment and served from Cloudflare's edge locations.

## File Structure

```
├── content/
│   └── blog/
│       ├── welcome-to-my-blog.md
│       ├── building-modern-react-applications-with-tanstack.md
│       └── README.md
├── scripts/
│   └── build-blog.js
├── public/
│   └── blog-data.json (generated)
├── .output/
│   └── public/
│       └── blog-data.json (included in deployment)
└── src/
    └── utils/
        └── blog.ts
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Production-Ready
- Static JSON generation for optimal performance
- Automatic content processing during build
- Cloudflare-optimized deployment

### ✅ Development-Friendly
- Hot-reload support in development
- Direct filesystem reading for instant updates
- Automatic fallback to JSON if needed

### ✅ Content Management
- Markdown files with frontmatter
- Automatic excerpt generation
- Reading time calculation
- Tag-based categorization

## Build Scripts

### Package.json Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "bun run build:blog && vite build",
    "build:blog": "bun run scripts/build-blog.js",
    "deploy:cloudflare": "bun run build && wrangler deploy"
  }
}
```

### Build Process

1. **Blog Generation** (`build:blog`):
   - Reads all `.md` files from `content/blog/`
   - Processes frontmatter and content
   - Generates `public/blog-data.json`
   - Calculates reading times and excerpts

2. **Vite Build** (`vite build`):
   - Builds the React application
   - Includes `blog-data.json` in output
   - Generates optimized bundles

3. **Deployment** (`deploy:cloudflare`):
   - Runs the complete build process
   - Deploys to Cloudflare Workers

## Blog Data Structure

The generated `blog-data.json` contains:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "post-slug",
      "title": "Post Title",
      "content": "Full markdown content",
      "excerpt": "Auto-generated or manual excerpt",
      "date": "2025-01-16",
      "slug": "post-slug",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "readTime": 3,
      "published": true,
      "author": "Author Name",
      "image": "optional-image-url"
    }
  ],
  "generatedAt": "2025-01-16T10:30:25.123Z",
  "totalPosts": 1
}
```

## API Functions

All blog utility functions are now async and work with the pre-built data:

```typescript
// Get all posts
const posts = await getAllPosts()

// Get single post
const post = await getPostBySlug('my-post-slug')

// Search posts
const results = await searchPosts('react')

// Get posts by tag
const taggedPosts = await getPostsByTag('javascript')

// Get related posts
const related = await getRelatedPosts(currentPost, 3)
```

## Adding New Blog Posts

1. **Create markdown file** in `content/blog/`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "My New Post"
   excerpt: "Brief description"
   date: "2025-01-16"
   tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
   published: true
   ---
   
   # My New Post
   
   Content goes here...
   ```

2. **Build and deploy**:
   ```bash
   bun run deploy:cloudflare
   ```

The new post will be automatically included in the next deployment.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blog data not loading**:
   - Ensure `blog-data.json` exists in `public/`
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Verify markdown frontmatter format

2. **Development vs Production differences**:
   - Development reads from filesystem
   - Production uses pre-built JSON
   - Use `bun run build:blog` to test production mode

3. **Content not appearing**:
   - Check `published: true` in frontmatter
   - Verify file extension (`.md` or `.mdx`)
   - Ensure proper frontmatter format

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test blog generation
bun run build:blog

# Check generated data
cat public/blog-data.json

# Full build test
bun run build

# Local preview
bun run dev
```
