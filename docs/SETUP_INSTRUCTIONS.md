# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Instructions

Your blog system has been updated with environment-based URL configuration! Here's how to complete the setup:

## Step 1: Environment Files (Already Created)

I've created basic environment files for you:

- âœ… `.env.local` - for development
- âœ… `.env.production` - for local production testing

## Step 2: GitHub Actions Deployment

For GitHub Actions deployment, see the **GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md** guide which shows you how to:
- Set up GitHub Secrets properly
- Configure environment variables securely
- Deploy without uploading `.env` files

## Step 3: Update URLs (If Needed)

### For Local Development
Your `.env.local` is already configured for local development:
```bash
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_NODE_ENV=development
```

### For Manual Production Testing
If you want to test production builds locally, update `.env.production`:
```bash
# Edit .env.production for your actual domain
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-actual-domain.com
VITE_NODE_ENV=production
```

**Note**: For GitHub Actions deployment, environment variables are handled through GitHub Secrets, not local `.env` files.

## Step 3: Test Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

You should see logs like:
```
Loading blog data from: http://localhost:3000/blog-data.json
Successfully loaded 2 blog posts
```

## Step 4: Deploy to Production

```bash
bun run deploy:cloudflare
```

## What's Fixed

- âœ… **Correct URLs**: Blog data loads from the right URL in both dev and prod
- âœ… **Environment-aware**: Automatically detects development vs production
- âœ… **Better debugging**: Clear error messages and logging
- âœ… **Cloudflare ready**: Works perfectly with Cloudflare deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you see "404 Not Found" errors:

1. **Check environment file**:
   ```bash
   cat .env.local
   ```

2. **Rebuild blog data**:
   ```bash
   bun run build:blog
   ```

3. **Restart dev server**:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

## For Different Hosting Platforms

### Cloudflare Pages
In your Cloudflare dashboard, set:
```
VITE_APP_URL = https://your-app.pages.dev
VITE_NODE_ENV = production
```

### Vercel
In Vercel dashboard:
```
VITE_APP_URL = https://your-app.vercel.app
VITE_NODE_ENV = production
```

### Netlify
In Netlify dashboard:
```
VITE_APP_URL = https://your-app.netlify.app
VITE_NODE_ENV = production
```

Your blog system is now properly configured for both development and production! ðŸŽ‰
